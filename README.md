FIR Drafting Assistant is a legal AI tool designed to assist in the automated drafting of First Information Reports (FIRs) based on crime narratives. Leveraging InLegalBERT, a domain-specific BERT model trained on Indian legal corpora, the system performs multi-label classification to predict relevant Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections applicable to the input text.
